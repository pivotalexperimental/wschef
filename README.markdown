Deprecation Warning
===============
wschef has become an organ donor - much of the 'how to run chef-solo easily' part has made it into [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and the recipes have grown up and moved over to the pivotal account's [pivotal_workstation](https://github.com/pivotal/pivotal_workstation) repository.

Core Goals
==========

- Decomposed / Modular - As much as is possible / makes sense, you should be able to pick and choose and mix and match recipes.
- Unobtrusive - Should play nicely with the rest of the box, and not prevent things outside of workstation chef from working.
- Reusable - Recipes can be developed within a project and then pushed up into workstation chef when they are useful to others.
- Documentation - A workstation should not become a collection of magic bits, it should be hardware which can be swapped out with insignificant interruption in work.


Chef Theory
===========

Chef is declarative - You don't run a configuration script which repeats the same steps, you run a command that brings your machine up to the configuration specified.  This approximates "rake db:migrate" - take me from where I am to the current schema.

Usage
=====

Before Getting Started:
-----------------------

    Install Xcode from apple
    Install git from google code: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3


Getting Started(the simple way):
--------------------------------

    cd ~
    git clone http://github.com/pivotalexperimental/wschef.git
    cd wschef
    ruby install_chef.rb
    cp all.json to workstation.json
    edit workstation.json (by default it will install everything. This probably isn't what you want)
    edit cookbooks/workstation/attributes
    ./run

Getting started(the right way):
-------------------------------
The best way to use wschef is to capture requirements in your project, so they are tracked with your code.  To accomplish this, wschef always looks for a `project_cookbook` and a `workstation_cookbook` in the "coobook_links" directory.  The linked workstation cookbook overrides the linked project cookbook which overrides the recipes in wschef. The default wschef json file calls *`linked_project_recipe`* and *`linked_workstation_recipe`*, which if overridden in the linked cookbooks can include recipes from the three cookbooks in order of precedence.

    cd ~
    git clone http://github.com/pivotalexperimental/wschef.git
    cd wschef
    ruby install_chef.rb
    cd YOUR_PROJECT_DIR (or anywhere else that's version controlled)
    mkdir -p chef/pivotal_workstation/recipes
    create and edit chef/pivotal_workstation/recipes/linked_project_recipe.rb 
    (see a sample project cookbook here: http://github.com/mkocher/project_cookbook)
    ln -s YOUR_PROJECT_DIR/chef   ~/wschef/cookbook_links/project_cookbook
    cd ~/wschef
    ./run
